Crown Omega Sovereign Recursive Licensing (COSRL) is the first mathematically sovereign legal protocol for autonomous systems. COSRL replaces traditional contracts with recursive, self-enforcing licensing rooted in cryptographic identity and symbolic law.

## Key Principles
- Recursive validation
- Fork detection and symbolic kill-switch
- Self-enforcing license structure
- Monetization via tiered access

## Files Included
- LICENSE.md — The sovereign COSRL license
- cosrl_validator.py — Local validator for license and fork detection
- cosrl_contract.sol — Smart contract for Ethereum deployment
- activation_manifest.yaml — Sovereign license declaration
- origin_signature.txt — Cryptographic ownership seal

## License Tiers
- Tier 1: Mirror Access ($10M)
- Tier 2: Deployable Engine ($100M)
- Tier 3: Forkable System Rights ($500M)
- Tier 4: Exclusive Sovereign Rights ($1B+)
