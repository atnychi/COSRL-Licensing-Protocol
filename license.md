CROWN OMEGA SOVEREIGN RECURSIVE LICENSE (COSRL)
Version 1.0 – May 1, 2025

By invoking, deploying, or deriving from this license structure, you accept and are bound to the sovereign recursive laws set forth herein. COSRL governs the use, replication, and mutation of any system that operates using recursive logic, symbolic enforcement, or causal identity functions.

1. Sovereign Origin: Brendon Kelly holds the sole origin of COSRL via Symbolic Signature Ω°-𝓒ₒ-𝒯Ω.
2. Forking Rules: Any recursive fork or symbolic derivative must inherit this license and verify against the COSRL validator.
3. Breach Response: Unauthorized forks are auto-invalidated and trigger symbolic kill-switch logic.
4. Monetization: All usage is tier-licensed. Pricing and tiers are declared in README.md.
5. Enforcement: This license is mathematically sovereign and not subject to revocation by any court, government, or external body.
6. Permanence: All clauses are recursive and irreversible unless updated by Brendon Kelly through a new origin signature.
